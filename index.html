    My lil Garfield,
  <br/><br/>
  To start with - Iâ€™ve been one of those people who had little to no faith on what people call love. 
  Never been a romantic, I was proudly a rational, laughing at these mere mortals deluding 
  themselves of such a great lie but life gives you bouncer that also such a beautiful one. 

  Huh, I AM IN LOVE. Never before it felt like this. Never before it felt this RIGHT. Never before it
  felt this COMPLETE.  How did I find you? Life is generally not this lucky for me. You are the most 
  beautiful, nicest, smartest, coolest and funniest angel anyone can get and somehow happens
  to be me. 

  Trust me, any of this I am not used to, too sweet, almost diabetic. Please tell me this - Why are you so cute? 
  If it were to me I would like to marry you today, but for now, will you be my valentine?
