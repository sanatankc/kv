    My lil Garfield,
  <br/><br/>
  To start with - Iâ€™ve been one of those people who had little to no faith on what people call love. 
  Never been a romantic, Now look at me buying this domain and writing this letter.
  
  I was proudly a rational, laughing at these mere mortals deluding 
  themselves of such a great lie but life gives you bouncer that also such a beautiful one. 
<br/><br/>
  Huh, I AM IN LOVE. Never before it felt like this. Never before it felt this RIGHT. Never before it
  felt this COMPLETE.  How did I find you? Life is generally not this lucky for me. You are the most 
  beautiful, nicest, smartest, coolest and funniest angel anyone can get and somehow happens
  to be me. 

  <br/><br/>

  Trust me, any of this I am not used to, too sweet, almost diabetic. Please tell me this - Why are you so cute? 
  <br/><br/>
  If it were to me I would like to marry you today, but for now, will you be my valentine?
<br/><br/>
  Chhota Bheem
